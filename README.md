# DBDoc

A full-stack booking and data management system built for tech repair shops.

---

## 🚀 Overview

DBDoc is designed to **streamline job tracking**, **simplify customer communication**, and **deliver meaningful insights** into your repair business operations. It combines a customer-facing booking interface with backend logic and a technician dashboard—built to make life easier on both sides of the counter.

> ⚠️ This is a work-in-progress project. The current version uses a monolithic "god file" structure—modularization and layout improvements are on the roadmap.
