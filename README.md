## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap / Planned Updates

> Short-term development goals for improving the project:

- [‚úîÔ∏è] **Introduce more environment variables** in the React app  
  Move away from hardcoded values and centralize config for flexibility and cleaner deployment.

- [ ] **Add data visualizations** to the PyQt5 desktop interface  
  Charts, graphs, or dashboards to give technicians/admins insight into business trends (e.g., Busy time of day, who is booking in the most jobs).

- [ ] **Refactor the PyQt5 "god file"** into multiple modules  
  Improve maintainability and readability by splitting the large monolithic script into separate components.
